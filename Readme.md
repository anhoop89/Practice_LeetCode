# Dynamic Programming (DP)

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a problem-solving technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem only once. It's particularly useful for optimization problems where the solution can be constructed from optimal solutions to subproblems.

## Key Concepts

1. **Memoization:** Storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

2. **Tabulation:** Constructing a table such that the value of each cell represents the solution to a subproblem, and using these values to solve larger subproblems.

3. **Optimal Substructure:** The property of a problem that allows the optimal solution to the problem to be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblems.

4. **Overlapping Subproblems:** Subproblems that are reused multiple times in the computation of the final solution.

5. **Bottom-up approach:** Solving subproblems iteratively starting from the simplest ones and gradually solving larger subproblems until the solution to the original problem is obtained.

6. **Top-down approach:** Solving subproblems recursively, storing the results of each subproblem in a data structure (such as a hash table or an array) to avoid redundant computations.

7. **State space:** The set of all possible configurations or states that a problem can be in.

8. **Transition function:** A function that defines the relationship between states and their successors in a dynamic programming problem.

9. **Optimization criterion:** The objective function or criteria used to evaluate the quality of a solution in optimization problems.

10. **Greedy choice property:** The property of certain problems where making a locally optimal choice at each step leads to a globally optimal solution.

These key concepts provide a foundation for understanding and solving dynamic programming problems efficiently.
